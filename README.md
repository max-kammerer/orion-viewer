## How to build project?

To build `Orion Viewer` you will need:

 * Android Studio 3.6+
 * android-sdk 28+
 * android-ndk 20+
 * make and python2 for mupdf
 * git

 * downloaded native libs (mupdf, djvu):

    `./gradlew -b  thirdparty_build.gradle downloadAndPatchDjvu downloadAndMakeMupdf`

    Build scripts for them are defined in `externalNativeBuild` section in gradle build files
    (for details see `djvuModule/build.gradle` and `mupdfModule/build.gradle`).
    Native libs are checked out into `nativeLibs/djvu` and `nativeLibs/mupdf` folders.

 * specify path to android-sdk in `local.properties` (use `local.properties.sample` as example).

 To build Android apk files run:

 `./gradlew :orion-viewer:assembleDebug` (or `assembleRelease`)

 It will generate `apk` artifacts suitable for Android 4.1+ devices.

 For Android 4.0.x devices use next command (it also requires android-ndk 17):

 ```
 ./gradlew :nativeLibs:djvuModule:clean :nativeLibs:mupdfModule:clean
 ./gradlew :orion-viewer:assembleArm7Debug -Porion.build.android40=true
 ```

Pre 0.80 versions are compatible with Android 2.1+ devices
